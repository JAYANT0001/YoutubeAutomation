# 📺 YouTube Automation Testing Suite

This project is a Selenium-based TestNG automation suite that performs various automated validations on **YouTube.com**. The suite interacts with several tabs (About, Movies, Music, News) and performs assertions using TestNG with a focus on real-world UI validations like text matching, element visibility, data-driven search validations, and more.
